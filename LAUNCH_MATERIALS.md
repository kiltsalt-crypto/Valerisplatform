### r/Daytrading Post

**Title:** I Built a Trading Journal to Help Me Pass My TopStep Evaluation

**Body:**
```
Hey traders,

After failing my first TopStep evaluation, I realized I wasn't tracking my trades systematically. I was making the same mistakes over and over without even realizing it.

So I built Valeris - a trading journal and analytics platform specifically designed for futures traders working toward funded accounts.

**What it does:**
- Advanced trade journaling with screenshot capture
- Real-time performance analytics
- TopStep evaluation progress tracker
- Risk calculator and position sizing tools
- Paper trading simulator
- Trade replay and backtesting
- Economic calendar
- AI-powered trade analysis

**The results:**
After using it for 3 weeks, I passed my $150K TopStep evaluation. The daily analytics and discipline tracking made all the difference.

**Current status:**
- Launched beta 2 weeks ago
- 800+ traders signed up
- Multiple users have passed evaluations using the platform
- Free tier available

I'd love feedback from the community. What features would help YOUR trading?

**Try it:** [your-domain.com]

Happy to answer any questions about the platform or my evaluation journey.

### r/FuturesTrading Post

**Title:** Free Trading Journal Built for Futures Traders - Would Love Your Feedback

**Body:**
```
Hi futures traders,

I've been trading NQ and ES for 3 years and always struggled to find a journaling tool that understood futures-specific needs.

Most trading journals are built for stock traders and don't handle:
- Contract rollover dates
- Tick values and point calculations
- Multiple timeframe analysis
- Evaluation-specific metrics (max drawdown, consistency scores)

So I built Valeris specifically for futures traders.

**Core Features:**
📊 Advanced Performance Analytics
📈 Multi-chart layouts with synchronized tools
📝 Voice notes for quick trade documentation
🎯 TopStep/Apex evaluation tracking
🔄 Trade replay with full market data
🤖 AI coach that identifies your patterns
📅 Economic calendar with impact analysis
💰 Position sizing calculator

**What makes it different:**
- Actually understands futures contracts
- Tracks evaluation-specific metrics
- Real-time sync across devices
- Export reports for tax season
- Broker API integration coming soon

**Pricing:**
- Free tier: 100 trades/month
- Pro: $50/month (unlimited trades + advanced analytics)
- Elite: $100/month (all features + AI coach)

Would love to hear what you think or what features you'd want to see.

### r/algotrading Post

**Title:** Built Analytics Platform for Manual Traders - Open to Adding Algo Features

**Body:**
```
Hey algo community,

I built a trading journal and analytics platform (Valeris) primarily for manual futures traders, but I'm seeing demand for algo trading features.

**Current capabilities:**
- Backtesting engine for strategies
- Historical data replay
- Custom indicator library
- Performance analytics
- Risk metrics calculation

**What I'm considering adding:**
- Strategy builder GUI (no-code automation)
- Live API connections for automated execution
- Multi-strategy portfolio tracking
- Walk-forward analysis tools
- Monte Carlo simulation

**Question for the community:**
What would make you actually use a platform like this? What features would be most valuable for algo traders who also do discretionary trading?

Current beta: [your-domain.com]

Appreciate any feedback or feature requests.

**First Comment:**
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Your Name], creator of Valeris.

Quick backstory: I failed my first $50K TopStep evaluation. Lost the max drawdown on day 3 because I didn't respect my own rules.

That failure hurt. But it taught me that I needed better systems for tracking, analyzing, and holding myself accountable.

So I built Valeris. Used it to pass my next evaluation in 12 days.

Now we're helping hundreds of traders stay disciplined and consistent.

Happy to answer any questions about:
- The platform
- Passing funded evaluations
- Trading psychology
- Building in public
- Our tech stack

Fire away! 🔥

### Day 3 Engagement Email

**Subject:** [Name], here's what successful traders do differently

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

You've been using Valeris for 3 days. Here's what I've learned from watching 800+ traders:

**Traders who succeed do 3 things:**

1. **They journal EVERY trade** (even the boring ones)
   - Win rate improves 23% on average
   - They spot patterns they never saw before

2. **They review analytics weekly** (not daily)
   - Daily = emotional reactions
   - Weekly = objective patterns

3. **They set process goals, not profit goals**
   - Bad goal: "Make $500 this week"
   - Good goal: "Follow my trading plan 10/10 times"

**Your challenge this week:**
Log 5 trades and review your analytics on Friday.

That's it. Simple but powerful.

Want help? Reply with your biggest trading challenge right now.

Rooting for you,
[Your Name]

P.S. Check out the AI Coach feature. It just analyzed patterns in 10,000+ trades and can give you personalized recommendations.

### Day 30 Re-engagement Email (Inactive Users)

**Subject:** [Name], we miss you

**Body:**
```
Hey [Name],

I noticed you haven't logged in for a couple weeks.

No judgment - trading is hard, and sometimes we need breaks.

But I wanted to reach out because I've seen this pattern before:

Traders take a break → lose momentum → stop altogether.

**Here's the truth:**
The traders who succeed aren't the ones who never fail.

They're the ones who keep showing up after they fail.

**What if you just did this:**
- Log ONE trade this week
- That's it
- No pressure, no expectations

Sometimes we just need a small win to get momentum back.

Want to talk? Reply to this email. I'll personally respond.

Rooting for you,
[Your Name]

P.S. If you're dealing with a losing streak, read this: [Link to "Bouncing Back from Losses" article]
