🚀 Excited to Launch Valeris - The Trading Platform Built for Consistency

After working with dozens of struggling traders, I noticed a pattern: Most had the knowledge but lacked the discipline, tracking, and community support to succeed.

That's why I built Valeris.

What is Valeris?

Valeris is an all-in-one trading platform that combines:
• Comprehensive trade journaling with AI-powered insights
• Paper trading simulator with real market data
• Expert-led education courses
• Community forum and mentorship marketplace
• Gamified accountability system

Why This Matters:

In an industry where 90% of retail traders fail, we're building tools that address the root causes of failure - not just providing more indicators or trading signals.

Key Features:
✅ Track and analyze every trade automatically
✅ Practice strategies risk-free
✅ Learn from funded traders
✅ Get accountability through gamification
✅ Track progress toward evaluation goals (TopStep, FTMO, etc.)

Who It's For:
• Aspiring funded traders
• Day traders looking to improve consistency
• Swing traders optimizing strategies
• Anyone serious about making trading a career

We're live today with special launch pricing.

Title: Built a trading journal + paper trading platform for serious traders [Free]

Hey r/Daytrading,

I'm a developer and part-time trader who got tired of juggling spreadsheets, TradingView, and random apps to track my progress.

So I built Valeris - an all-in-one platform specifically for traders who want to actually improve.

**What it does:**
- Comprehensive trade journaling (screenshots, notes, P&L tracking)
- Paper trading with real market data
- Analytics that show you exactly where you're losing money
- Trading courses from funded traders
- Community forum
- Gamification/streaks to keep you accountable

**Why I built it:**
After blowing my first account, I realized I needed better discipline and tracking. Spreadsheets weren't cutting it. Existing apps were either too expensive or missing key features.

**Current status:**
Just launched today. Free tier available, pro plans for advanced features.

**Would love feedback from this community:**
- What features would you want?
- What's missing from your current setup?
- What would actually make you more profitable?

Happy to answer questions!

### First Comment
```
👋 Hey Product Hunt!

I'm [Your Name], creator of Valeris.

**The Story:**
I blew my first trading account ($5K) in 3 months. The problem wasn't my strategy - it was lack of discipline and tracking.

I tried spreadsheets, various apps, even built custom tools. Nothing stuck.

So I built Valeris - the platform I wish I had when I started.

**What Makes Us Different:**

1. **All-in-One**: Stop juggling TradingView + Excel + Discord + separate journal app. Everything's integrated.

2. **AI-Powered**: Our AI coach analyzes your trades and spots patterns you'd miss.

3. **Community-First**: Trading is lonely. We've built an active community of traders helping each other.

4. **Evaluation-Focused**: Specific tools for traders pursuing TopStep, FTMO, etc.

**What's Next:**
- Broker integrations (E*TRADE, Schwab) - coming this month
- Mobile apps (iOS/Android) - Q1 2024
- Advanced backtesting - Q2 2024
- Live trading rooms - Q2 2024

**Special for Product Hunt:**
Code PRODUCTHUNT50 → 50% off Pro for 3 months

**I'm here all day to answer questions!**

What features would you want in your dream trading platform?
